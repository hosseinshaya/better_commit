Better Commit is a Dart package that uses AI to generate meaningful commit messages based on your code changes.

‚ùå Before ü§Æ

```bash
git commit -m "update version"
```

‚úÖ After üòé

```bash
git commit -m "üöÄ [RELEASE] Update version to 1.4.0" -m "Update version number in pubspec.yaml and changelog."
```

## Installation

```bash
dart pub global activate better_commit
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Get an API Key

Using the Google AI Dart SDK requires an API key. Follow the instructions at [https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup) to create one.

### 2. Set the API Key

Set your API key as an environment variable:

#### For Linux and MacOS

```

To add this forever you can add it to:
~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc

### 3. Let the Magic Work

Now you're ready to use Better Commit! Simply stage your changes and run:

```bash
git add .
better-commit
```

The AI will analyze your changes and generate a commit message for you.

## Custom Commit Messages

If you want to provide additional context for the AI, you can use the `--custom` flag:

```bash
better-commit --custom
```

This will prompt you to enter an optional commit message, which the AI will consider when generating the final commit message.
Using custom flag, You can provide a simple and short message and ai will complete it.

## How It Works

Better Commit uses the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to analyze your staged changes and generate a concise, meaningful commit message. It follows the format:

emoji [TAG] commit message
